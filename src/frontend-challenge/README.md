## Brief

_Extracted from PDF._

- Assuming that they have uploaded 6 images in total from 2 different types of cameras and they have added the meta data during the process of uploading. (see example JSON)
- We would like you to create a view showing the images and associated meta data which has a toggle that enables the Optometrist to group images by modality or examination date. You donâ€™t have to worry about headers and footers for the view. You can use the images provided.
- You can assume this app to only be run in modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) supporting recent features.
- Styles from https://www.oculo.com.au/ (as a guide)

## Scope
